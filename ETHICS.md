**Ethical Considerations**

1. **Data Source Transparency**:  
   We clearly state that the data is sourced from publicly available websites:  
   By using recognized, reputable sources, we ensure that the data we collect is reliable and not derived through deception.  
   * PeopleForBikes City Ratings: A publicly accessible rating system.  
   * CityBikes API: An open API offering bikeshare information worldwide.  
2. **No Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**:  
   The data collected pertains to city-level statistics and bikeshare network operators. There is no collection of individual users’ travel patterns or personal details. This avoids privacy violations and reduces ethical risks related to personal data handling.  
3. **Data Integrity and Representation**:  
   We do not alter the rating scores or bikeshare network details. Our role is limited to aggregation and normalization. This ensures that end-users receive accurate reflections of the original data, reducing the risk of misinformation.  
4. **Cultural and Social Sensitivity**:  
   The dataset focuses on biking infrastructure and services and does not involve sensitive topics like race, religion, or political ideology. It’s purely transportation and urban planning data, minimizing potential cultural bias or harm.  
5. **Accessibility and Transparency**:  
   The tool and dataset are made openly available, allowing others to review, critique, and suggest improvements. By being open-source, we encourage community oversight, which can improve data ethics over time.  
6. **Non-Discrimination**:  
   The dataset includes a wide range of cities globally. We do not favor one region over another, and our normalization methods do not exclude or disproportionately impact any particular locale. While the rating system may initially focus on certain regions (like North America), the combined dataset attempts to broaden the scope by including global bikeshare data.
